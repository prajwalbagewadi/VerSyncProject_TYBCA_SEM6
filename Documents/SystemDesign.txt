give me a use case scenario in paragraph form ABOUT version control system.

give me mermaid.js code for creating erd of my use case scenario.A software development team working on a large-scale web application relies on a version control system (VCS) to manage their code efficiently. The team consists of developers, testers, and project managers, all collaborating on different features simultaneously.

One of the developers, Alice, is assigned to implement a new authentication feature. She creates a new branch in the repository to work on the feature without affecting the main codebase. As she progresses, she makes multiple commits, ensuring each change is well-documented. Meanwhile, her teammate Bob is working on a different branch, adding a new dashboard UI.

Once Alice completes her feature, she submits a pull request (PR) for code review. The VCS automatically assigns priority to the PR based on its complexity and impact. A reviewer, Charlie, is notified and begins the review process. Using a standardized review template, Charlie provides feedback on some security improvements. Alice makes the necessary changes and updates the PR.

After approval, the PR is merged into the main branch, and automated tests are triggered to ensure nothing is broken. If conflicts arise due to parallel changes by Bob, the system suggests AI-assisted conflict resolutions to streamline the process. Once resolved, the changes are successfully integrated.

Meanwhile, the project manager, David, monitors progress through the system’s issue tracking and analytics dashboard. He can see which issues are resolved, PRs merged, and upcoming tasks. This helps ensure that the project stays on schedule while maintaining high code quality and collaboration efficiency.

This version control system enhances team productivity, reduces merge conflicts, and maintains a clear project history, ensuring smooth development and deployment processes.

	Users interact with the system to create repositories, manage issues, and review pull requests.
	The system communicates with a database to store and retrieve data.
DFD Level 1
	Users create issues → Issues are categorized → Notifications are sent.
	Pull requests are created → prioritization → Reviewers are assigned → Code is reviewed and merged.  mermeiad
